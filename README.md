This Python program processes a text file by reading its contents, cleaning the words, and performing a word frequency analysis. The program outputs the ten most frequently used words and displays the number of unique words as well as how many of those words appear only once. The tool helps in analyzing word usage in a given text file, making it useful for textual data exploration and insights.

Description:
This Python project reads the contents of a text file, processes the words to clean them of punctuation, converts them to lowercase, and filters out words shorter than 4 characters. It then counts the occurrences of each word and outputs:

1. The 10 most frequently used words, along with their frequency.
2. The total number of unique words in the document.
3. The number of words that occur only once.

This tool is useful for text analysis tasks such as finding the most commonly used words in a document or identifying patterns in word frequency.

Features:
- Reads a text file (.txt) input from the user.
- Cleans words by stripping punctuation and converting them to lowercase.
- Displays the top 10 most frequently used words.
- Shows the total number of unique words and how many occur only once.

How to use:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.x).
4. Run the `main.py` file
5. A prompt to enter the file to analyze will appear
6. Test by inputing "test.txt" into the terminal
7. Restat and test again by inputing "test2.txt", "declOfInd.txt", "gettysburg copy.txt", or "gettysburg.txt" into the terminal
This will test the test files in the repository as the user chooses to. The user can also choose to add their own file to the same folder as this repository to analyze it. Note: the name of the file to analyze needs to be typed ending it ".txt"
